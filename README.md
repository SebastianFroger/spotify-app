This is a small learning project built using react, and fetching data from the spotify API. 
The main purpose of the project was to practice javascript and general front end development.

The application looks for all new releases from the artists that you follow. If anything has been released since the last time you checked, those releases will be displayed in a list of cards with info about the release.
